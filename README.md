Creating a basic web app using React that displays Star Wars characters and provides information about them. You can include any additional libraries you want to.
Make sure the application is somewhat responsive and accessible.

There are three features to implement:
1.	List all the Star Wars characters. Paginate. 
2.	Display additional information about the characters when their names are clicked. 
3.	Implement a search feature allowing the user to filter the characters
